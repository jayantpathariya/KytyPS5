// What guest-memory write tracking costs on this PC.
//
// The GPU caches write-protect the guest pages they mirror and catch the guest's first write to
// each: a host exception (Windows: a vectored exception handler; Linux: SIGSEGV, or SIGBUS with
// userfaultfd write-protection) and a protection change (VirtualProtect, mprotect or
// UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT) per fault, and another protection change when the page is uploaded and
// protected again. At the Astro Bot Sky Garden that is ~1,300-1,700 faults and ~800-900 protection
// calls per frame. Their cost differs by more than 10x between PCs: ~5 us per fault here (Windows,
// RTX 3090 + 7950X3D), ~80 us on a Linux PC (mprotect takes the mmap lock for writing, which every
// page fault of the process then waits for).
//
// Startup benchmark (always on, a few ms; Windows and Linux): a write-fault round trip on a
// write-protected page of a shared-memory view (the kind of mapping guest memory is), and the
// protection calls (read-only and read-write, 1 and 64 pages). Logged as "Kyty fault cost: ...",
// with the platform facts that decide these costs ("Kyty platform: ...": Windows code integrity /
// hypervisor / hooked ntdll entry points / injected modules; Linux kernel, vm.max_map_count,
// mappings, userfaultfd features).
//
// Live numbers (always on): every guest fault the tracker resolves and every protection call is
// timed (two clock reads). KYTY_FAULT_COST_LOG=<seconds> (default 60, 0 = off) logs one line with
// the counts and average costs of the last period. Model() combines the startup benchmark (the part
// of a fault outside the handler) with the live in-handler averages.
//
// Slow-PC simulation (diagnostic, default off, live switches): busy-waits added to this PC's costs.
//   KYTY_SIM_FAULT_US=<us>          every guest fault the tracker resolves, before any lock
//   KYTY_SIM_PROTECT_US=<us>        every protection call that tightens (read-only, no-access)
//   KYTY_SIM_PROTECT_PAGE_NS=<ns>   ... plus this per page
//   KYTY_SIM_UNPROTECT_US=<us>      every protection call that makes pages writable
//   KYTY_SIM_UNPROTECT_PAGE_NS=<ns> ... plus this per page
// The protection waits hold one process-wide lock with the real call, as the OS serializes the
// protection changes of an address space (mmap_lock for writing on Linux).
//   KYTY_SIM_SERIAL=0               the fault wait runs in parallel on each thread instead of
//                                   holding that lock too (default 1: Linux, where the fault waits
//                                   for the mmap lock that every mprotect holds for writing)
//
// Fault map (diagnostic, KYTY_FAULT_MAP=1): which guest ranges fault, from which threads (the
// command processor, guest threads, other host threads) and code (guest code or the emulator), how
// often the same page faults again (same frame, next frame, every N frames), the protection calls
// per thread and direction, and how the in-handler time splits between the buffer cache, the
// texture cache and the deferred protection update. One block of "FaultMap" lines every
// KYTY_FAULT_MAP_SECONDS (default 10) on the command processor's flip.

// so it cannot choose the window. The tightening protection calls (read-only or no-access, made
// when uploads re-protect pages) keep their size whatever the window: their fixed part (time per
